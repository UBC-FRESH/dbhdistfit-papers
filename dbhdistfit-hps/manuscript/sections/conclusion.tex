\section{Conclusion}

We presented a weighted fitting procedure that reproduces the behaviour of the
traditional size-biased estimator for deriving stem diameter distributions from
HPS data. The method is easier to implement, numerically stable, and accompanied
by a fully reproducible research package. Updated experiments confirm that the
weighted and size-biased estimators yield indistinguishable fits across a range
of species groups, cover types, and target distributions. We recommend adopting
the weighted formulation in operational workflows and using the provided
templates as a foundation for future methodological extensions.
