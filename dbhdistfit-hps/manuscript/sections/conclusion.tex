\section{Conclusion}

We presented a weighted fitting procedure that reproduces the behaviour of the
traditional size-biased estimator for deriving stem diameter distributions from
HPS data. The method is easier to implement, numerically stable, and accompanied
by a fully reproducible research package. Updated experiments confirm that the
weighted and size-biased estimators yield indistinguishable fits across a range
of species groups, cover types, and target distributions. The formal proof in
Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-equivalence} codifies this equivalence and supports
adoption of the weighted formulation in operational workflows. We recommend
using the provided templates as a foundation for future methodological
extensions.
